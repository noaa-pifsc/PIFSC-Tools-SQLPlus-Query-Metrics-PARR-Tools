X develop automation schedule (cron job) for executing the existing docker images (hourly between 7 AM to 7 PM each day)
	X Implement as a Windows scheduled task


X Implement TNSNames.ora for the docker container	


X Specify V_DB_NAME in a configuration.sql file so the user doesn't have to change the calling script
	They could also change the output file name so there doesn't need to separate calling scripts at all for the forked repositories

X Change deployment scripts so they use variables instead (e.g. repository URL, deployment path, etc.)
	X This way the configuration files change but the main scripts will be the same as the upstream repository)
	
	
Elapsed time of the query
	grant select any dictionary to LHP_INTL_BIO;
	select SQL_TEXT, elapsed_time from v$sql where SQL_TEXT LIKE '%%';
